## Prerequisites

Before you can run the examples, please refer to the [Node.js Getting Started guide](./../getting_started/nodejs) to install
the library.

### Set Up Your .env file

The code examples use a `.env` file to store variables. You can download
the [example file](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/develop/wallet/.env.example) or create a new one with
the following variables:

```dotenv
NON_SECURE_USE_OF_DEVELOPMENT_MNEMONIC="endorse answer radar about source reunion marriage tag sausage weekend frost daring base attack because joke dream slender leisure group reason prepare broken river"
STRONGHOLD_PASSWORD="some_hopefully_secure_password"
NODE_URL="http://localhost:14265"
FAUCET_URL="http://localhost:8091/api/enqueue"
```

You should update the `NODE_URL` and `FAUCET_URL` values to match the [Hornet node](#hornet-node) you want to use.

## Install Dependencies

Before you can try out the examples, you must install the necessary dependencies using npm. You can do this by running
the following command from the `binding/nodejs` directory:

```bash
npm i
```

### Build the Library

Once you have [set up your `.env` file](#setup-your-env-file) and [installed the necessary dependencies](#install-dependencies)
, you can build the library by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run the Examples

The wallet.rs library has numerous examples you can run to get acquainted with the library.
After you have followed the instructions to [build the library](#build-the-library), you can run any Node.js example.
You will need to select any of the
[Node.js examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/wallet/bindings/nodejs/examples/) and run it with
your local Node.js interpreter.

To run examples, you will need to change to the `bindings/nodejs/examples` directory, and run any example.
The following command will run the `10-node-info.js` example:

```bash
node 10-node-info.js
```
