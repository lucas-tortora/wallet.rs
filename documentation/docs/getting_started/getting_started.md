# IOTA Wallet Libraries

The `wallet.rs` library is written in Rust. You can also find a bindings written in Node.js and Python.

- [Rust](rust.md)
- [Node.js](nodejs.md)
- [Python](python.md)

## Getting Started

We recommended that you start your interactions with IOTA on a _testnet_ network. The _testnet_ will allow you to safely
get acquainted with the `wallet.rs` library, without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the way.
You can use this API load balancer: `https://api.testnet.shimmer.network`

A network explorer is available at [IOTA Tangle Explorer](TODO: set correct explorer link). You can use the network
explorer to view transactions and data stored in the IOTA Tangle.

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens! You can get
some testnet tokens through our [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).
